# Start Here

## Structure

The backend is divided into three parts.
```
â””â”€â”€â”€backend
    â”œâ”€â”€â”€app <-- Fast API app
    â”œâ”€â”€â”€genius <-- Class and methods for Genius API
    â””â”€â”€â”€twitter <-- Class and method for Twitter API
```

`genius` and `twitter` will be called within `app` for our final product.

In addition to that, we are using `nltk` to process the tweets and figure out the most common words from a user's timeline
