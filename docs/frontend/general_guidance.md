General React notes/tips for beginners:

 - Always choose functional components over class components. Especially now that [React hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) exist and offer everything that class components do (ie using state, lifecycle methods).
 - Higher order components (HOCs) will be a big help with creating reusable components and offer a great way to share logic without repeating in different parts of your app.
 - Start using PropTypes from the beginning
 - All JSX/component attributes/props should be on a new line.
 - JSX/React components are self closing, utilize this feature when possible.
 - Props should be destructured for easier readability and cleaner code (https://medium.freecodecamp.org/the-basics-of-destructuring-props-in-react-a196696f5477)
 - Make components as small as possible.
 - Vscode react extensions (keyboard shortcuts help to scaffold components faster, https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=xabikos.ReactSnippets) and speed up development.
